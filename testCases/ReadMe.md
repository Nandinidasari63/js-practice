# Guardian of the Calendar

In the Kingdom of Chronia, the royal timekeeper Aurelius guards the **Great Calendar of Eternity**. Each day, the calendar reveals the next date, ensuring the kingdom runs in harmony.

But after a violent storm, the calendar’s magic faltered. It now risks producing the wrong **“tomorrow.”** If this happens, festivals may vanish, markets may collapse, and even the King’s birthday could be lost in time.

Aurelius has asked for your help.

## Your Task
You are not to repair the calendar yourself. Instead, you must design a comprehensive set of test cases.

These test cases will be handed to Aurelius, who will use them to uncover the flaws and restore the Great Calendar.

Your test cases should clearly specify:
- The input date provided to the calendar(format of **dd-mm-yyyy**).
- The expected next date (or outcome).

Consider normal cases, edge cases and error cases.(Expected for error cases "Invalid Date")

## Expected Format
| Description | Input | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Simple increment of a normal day | 15-03-2021 | 16-03-2021 |

Write all your test cases in next_date_tests.md
